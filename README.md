# Lethal Dungeon
A complete unity project which contains all of the pieces required to make a dungeon for Lethal Company. It contains class declarations required to spawn scrap, turrets, etc but does not include any of Lethal Companies Definition code.

# Dependencies
- You will need a copy of the plugin DunGen to use this project. The files must be placed in Assets/DunGen. Do not replace the .meta files already in there.

# Special Thanks
- Badhamknibbs for the SCP dungeon which helped me understand how to build the BepinEx plugin.
- LethalLib for giving us the tools to get things into the game!
- The Lethal Company modding Community at large!

# Attributions and licenses
